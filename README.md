# plainttext_LTE
a set of simple steps to get from "I don't know WTF BBQ" to "I am service provider"


I will try to provide these steps in a set of plain english styles, with easy, medium, and hard mode

## motivation
The FCC, some FAANGs, and others are motivated to see more innovation in the wireless space to try to see what new tech can come about. Unfortunately, the expertise is surrounded in jargon, domain and tribal knowledge, and can be very frustrating for someone who wants to take the shortcut route to running a mobile network.

I had a lot of exposure to testing early stage lTE and then 5G networks. My motivation is to try to demystify as much of the mobile network as I can for anyone with a strong but non-wireless focused background to understand how a 4G/5G network operates in plaint english and to enable those that are interested to set one up with minimal effort.
